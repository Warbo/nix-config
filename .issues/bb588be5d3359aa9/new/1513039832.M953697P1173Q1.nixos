See
https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/7h8np7/stack_or_cabal_which_one_is_more_preferable_for/

In particular, developPackage and callCabal2Nix

Can we simplify tincify by getting rid of tinc completely, and just
using cabal to resolve a list of dependencies, then using callCabal2Nix
with those?
