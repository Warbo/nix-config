Subject: Use newer cabal-install in haskellPkgDeps
Message-Id: <f2933673003213d8-0-artemis@nixos>

It's currently hard-coded to nixpkgs1609 because cabal 2.0 seems to
break stuff.

In particular, it seems unable to find the package index we get from
stableHackageDb. This *may* be something to do with the new 01-index.tar
cache, but I'm not sure.
