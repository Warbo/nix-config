# This one package depends on all of the packages we want in our user profile
# so we don't need to keep track of everything separately. If you're on NixOS
# you can make these available system-wide using /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
# If you're using Nix standalone, or want per-user configuration, you can run
# a command like `nix-env -iA all` to install into your profile.
