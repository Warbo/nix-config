This should contain machine-specific config, to be used in conjunction with
the main configuration.

Note that wsl is currently stored separately, in ../nixos-wsl. That is so
we can symlink that directory to /etc/nixos. Not sure if it's a good idea
to do that with the other machines too? (Although Thinkpad doesn't boot
anymore, so it's mostly useful for archaeological purposes).
